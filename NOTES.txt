NOTES:

1. https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html nasa datasets for exoplanets
2. https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_PS_columns.html definition for the query api
3. interesting plot insolation flux v orbitial period negatively related because short period means closer to star means more solar energy



WHAT DO I WANT TO DO

1. color composite of stars/planets/galaxies
2. plot in 3d space of all exoplanet systems
3. spike ball where each line goes to an exoplanet and the color matches the star color. 80s style graphics if possible
4. color spectrum applied to various features then plotted into quilt ordered by a different feature
5. train model to predict trends based on one feature for others (this could be just regression models probs)
6. spectra data from planet atmospheres -> convert to colors and plot
7. types of visuals: spike-ball, 3d compressed space, rectangle quilt, melting plot of colors, ripples away from our system
